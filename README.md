## 🔍 SHAP Implementation

### What is SHAP?

**SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** is a unified framework for explaining machine learning model outputs. It provides:

- **Global Explanations**: Overall feature importance across all predictions
- **Local Explanations**: Individual prediction explanations showing why a specific sample was classified as a particular fault
- **Feature Interactions**: How features work together to influence predictions

### SHAP Explainers Used

1. **KernelExplainer** (for SVC)
   - Model-agnostic explainer suitable for non-linear models
   - Uses weighted linear regression to approximate SHAP values
   - Handles multi-class classification with probability outputs

2. **LinearExplainer** (for Logistic Regression)
   - Optimized for linear models
   - Computationally efficient
   - Provides exact SHAP values for linear relationships

### SHAP Visualizations Implemented

1. **Summary Plots (Beeswarm)**
   - Shows distribution of SHAP values for each feature
   - Color-coded by feature value (red = high, blue = low)
   - Reveals feature impact patterns

2. **Bar Plots**
   - Mean absolute SHAP values per feature
   - Quick overview of global feature importance
   - Easy to interpret ranking

3. **Waterfall Plots**
   - Individual prediction explanations
   - Shows how each feature pushes prediction from base value
   - Critical for understanding specific misclassifications

4. **Partial Dependence Plots**
   - Shows how individual features affect predictions
   - Reveals non-linear relationships
   - Guides feature engineering

5. **Feature Importance Heatmaps**
   - Fault-type-specific feature importance
   - Severity progression patterns
   - Visual comparison across fault types

### 4. Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy**: Overall classification correctness
- **Precision**: Per-class precision scores

## 📈 Key Results

### Model Performance Summary

| Model | Accuracy | Avg ROC-AUC | Avg PR-AUC | Misclassifications |
|-------|----------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| **SVC (Best)** | **96.4%** | **0.731** | **0.623** | **27/750** |
| **Logistic Regression** | **94.3%** | **0.656** | **0.606** | **43/750** |

**Note**: Performance metrics are reported on the full test set (750 samples). Detailed SHAP explainability analysis was performed on a 200-sample subset for computational efficiency, achieving 98% accuracy (196/200 correct) on that subset.

### Per-Class Performance (SVC)

- **Perfect Classification** (100% precision/recall on initial model): IR_007_1, IR_014_1, IR_021_1, OR_007_6_1, OR_021_6_1, Normal_1
- **High Performance** (>95% F1-score): Ball_007_1, Ball_021_1
- **Good Performance** (>90% F1-score): Ball_014_1
- **Note**: Some classes (Ball_014_1, Ball_021_1, OR_014_6_1) showed multiple misclassifications in the full test set, primarily involving confusion between similar severity levels

### Misclassification Analysis

**Full Test Set (750 samples)**: **27 misclassifications** (3.6% error rate)

**Primary Misclassification Patterns:**
- Ball_014_1: 9 misclassifications (confused with Normal_1, OR_014_6_1, and other classes)
- Ball_021_1: 8 misclassifications (primarily confused with OR_014_6_1)
- OR_014_6_1: 8 misclassifications (confused with Ball_021_1, Ball_014_1, and Ball_007_1)
- Ball_007_1: 1 misclassification
- OR_021_6_1: 1 misclassification

**SHAP Analysis Subset (200 samples)**: **4 misclassifications** analyzed in detail:
1. OR_014_6_1 → Predicted as Ball_021_1
2. Ball_014_1 → Predicted as Normal_1
3. Ball_021_1 → Predicted as OR_014_6_1

**Key Insight**: Most errors involve confusion between similar severity levels (0.014" vs 0.021") and between Ball and Outer Race faults at similar severities, indicating the model struggles with subtle severity distinctions but excels at fault location identification for clearly distinct classes.

## 🔑 Key Findings

### 1. Global Feature Importance

**SVC Model Top Features:**
1. **Crest Factor** (0.0508) - Most discriminative
2. **Minimum** (0.0366) - Extreme value detection
3. **Mean** (0.0291) - Amplitude baseline
4. **Skewness** (0.0256) - Distribution shape
5. **Kurtosis** (0.0222) - Tail behavior

**Logistic Regression Top Features:**
1. **Mean** (1.739) - Dominant feature
2. **Standard Deviation** (1.462)
3. **RMS** (1.456)
4. **Form Factor** (1.200)
5. **Kurtosis** (1.142)

**Critical Insight**: Only **Mean** and **Kurtosis** appear in top 5 for both models, indicating these are universal fault indicators regardless of model architecture.

### 2. Fault-Location-Specific Patterns

**Inner Race (IR) Faults:**
- **Primary Indicator**: Mean amplitude (importance: 0.1299 for IR_014_1)
- **Pattern**: Mean importance decreases with severity (0.1299 → 0.0828 → 0.0300)
- **Implication**: Amplitude monitoring critical for IR fault detection

**Outer Race (OR) Faults:**
- **Primary Indicator**: Kurtosis (importance: 0.0805 for OR_021_6_1)
- **Pattern**: Kurtosis importance increases with severity (0.0310 → 0.0470 → 0.0805)
- **Implication**: Distribution shape analysis essential for OR faults

**Ball Faults:**
- **Primary Indicators**: Mean + Kurtosis (balanced approach)
- **Pattern**: Relatively stable feature patterns across severities
- **Implication**: Combined amplitude and shape analysis needed

**Normal Condition:**
- **Pattern**: Requires balanced consideration of multiple features
- **Top Features**: Kurtosis, RMS, SD, Mean (all similar importance)

### 3. Model Comparison Insights

**Feature Agreement:**
- **Common Features**: Only Mean and Kurtosis (limited overlap)
- **SVC-Specific**: Crest factor, Min, Skewness (non-linear patterns)
- **LR-Specific**: SD, Form Factor, RMS (linear amplitude relationships)

**Correlation Analysis:**
- **Feature Importance Correlation**: -0.404 (negative correlation)
- **Interpretation**: Models use fundamentally different decision strategies
- **SVC**: Emphasizes distribution shape and extremes
- **LR**: Emphasizes central tendency and variability

**Practical Implication**: Ensemble methods could leverage complementary strengths of both models.

### 4. Severity Progression Patterns

| Fault Type | Severity Trend | Key Feature |
|------------|----------------|-------------|
| **IR Faults** | Mean ↓ with severity | Mean amplitude |
| **OR Faults** | Kurtosis ↑ with severity | Distribution shape |
| **Ball Faults** | Stable patterns | Mean + Kurtosis |

**Predictive Maintenance Value**: These patterns enable tracking fault progression by monitoring specific feature trends.

## 📊 SHAP Insights

### Global Explanations

**Feature Ranking (SVC):**
- Crest factor dominates, indicating peak-to-average ratio is critical
- Minimum values important for detecting extreme events
- Statistical distribution features (skewness, kurtosis) capture non-linear patterns

**Feature Ranking (Logistic Regression):**
- Mean amplitude is the dominant linear feature
- Standard deviation and RMS provide complementary amplitude information
- Form factor captures waveform characteristics

### Local Explanations

**Correctly Classified Samples:**
- Strong feature alignment with expected fault characteristics
- Clear separation in SHAP value distributions
- Consistent patterns across samples of same fault type

**Misclassified Samples:**
- Mixed feature signals with intermediate values
- Conflicting SHAP contributions
- Boundary cases where feature distributions overlap

### Fault-Specific Insights

**SHAP Analysis Reveals:**
1. Different fault locations require different monitoring strategies
2. Severity progression follows predictable feature trends
3. Feature importance varies significantly by fault type
4. Some features are universally important (mean, kurtosis)
5. Others are fault-specific (crest for SVC, SD for LR)
